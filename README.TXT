Justification 1 - One of the greatest benefits of using the lambda expression in this case is in conserving the amount of
                  code needed to accomplish the same task.  Likewise, this prevents bugs and errors which also slow down the
                  coding process.

Justification 2 - By utilizing the lambda in this case, it would be able to be used throughout the code as an argument
                  therefore allowing functional programming, improving readability, and reducing the amount of code needed
                  to accomplish the same task.
